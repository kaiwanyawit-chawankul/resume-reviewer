I see you have a Python dictionary that maps skill categories (currently just "technology") to a comprehensive list of tech skills. You're looking for a dataset or database that provides similar skill categorization that you can use with your code.

Here are some suggestions for free datasets and resources you could use:

1. **GitHub Skills API and Repositories**:
   - The [GitHub Skills API](https://developer.github.com/v3/topics/) can provide trending topics/skills
   - Public repositories like [skills-taxonomy](https://github.com/workforce-data-initiative/skills-taxonomy) contain structured skill datasets

2. **Public Data Sources**:
   - [Kaggle Datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets) - search for "skills taxonomy" or "tech skills"
   - [Data.gov](https://www.data.gov/) - particularly O*NET data which categorizes occupational skills

3. **O*NET Resource Center**:
   - [O*NET Online](https://www.onetonline.org/) offers a free database of occupational information including skills taxonomies
   - They provide downloadable databases that include detailed skill categorization

4. **ESCO (European Skills/Competences, Qualifications and Occupations)**:
   - Provides a multilingual classification of skills that you can download in various formats

5. **Open Skills API**:
   - [Open Skills API](https://github.com/workforce-data-initiative/skills-api) - provides access to a curated skills database

To integrate with your current code structure, you could download one of these datasets (typically in CSV, JSON, or XML format) and parse it to construct your skill_categories dictionary. For example:

```python
import pandas as pd
import json

# Example using a CSV file
def load_skills_from_csv(filepath):
    df = pd.read_csv(filepath)
    skill_categories = {}
    for category in df['category'].unique():
        skill_categories[category.lower()] = df[df['category'] == category]['skill_name'].str.lower().tolist()
    return skill_categories

# Example using a JSON file
def load_skills_from_json(filepath):
    with open(filepath, 'r') as f:
        return json.load(f)

# Then replace your hardcoded dictionary with:
self.skill_categories = load_skills_from_csv('path/to/skills_dataset.csv')
# or
self.skill_categories = load_skills_from_json('path/to/skills_dataset.json')
```

Would you like more specific information about any of these sources or help with implementing the data import for your specific use case?
