I'd be happy to help you create a resume review app in Python! This app will compare job descriptions with resume information and provide a matching score. Let's build this step by step.

First, let's outline what we'll need:

1. A way to input job descriptions and resume information (as text or JSON)
2. Text processing to extract key information
3. A matching algorithm to compare the resume against job requirements
4. A scoring system to provide feedback

Here's a complete Python application that accomplishes this:

I've created a complete Python application for reviewing resumes against job descriptions. Let me walk you through how it works:

## Features

1. **Input Flexibility**: Accepts both plain text (separated by a delimiter) or JSON format
2. **Text Processing**: Uses NLTK for tokenization, removing stopwords, and lemmatizing text
3. **Similarity Calculation**: Employs TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity for matching
4. **Skill Detection**: Identifies technical skills in both job description and resume
5. **Comprehensive Scoring**: Provides scores for overall match, similarity, skills, education, and experience
6. **Recommendations**: Offers tailored suggestions based on the match score

## How to Use the App

1. Run the script in your Python environment
2. Input your data in one of two formats:
   - **JSON format**:
     ```json
     {
       "job_description": "Your job description text",
       "resume": "Your resume text"
     }
     ```
   - **Plain text format**:
     ```
     Your job description text
     ---RESUME---
     Your resume text
     ```
3. Type `END` on a new line when finished entering your input
4. Review the detailed analysis and recommendations

## Sample Output

The application will generate an analysis with:
- Overall match score (percentage)
- Similarity score based on text comparison
- Skill match percentage with lists of matching and missing skills
- Education and experience scores
- Tailored recommendations based on the match quality
- Complete JSON output for further processing

## Technical Details

- Uses NLTK for natural language processing
- Implements TF-IDF and cosine similarity from scikit-learn
- Includes predefined keyword lists for skills, education, and experience
- Employs a weighted scoring system that considers multiple factors

Would you like me to explain any particular part of the code in more detail, or would you like suggestions on how to enhance this application further?
