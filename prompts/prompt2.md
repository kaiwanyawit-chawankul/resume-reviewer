Great idea! Let's transform the resume review application into a web API using FastAPI and containerize it with Docker. This will make it much more versatile and easier to deploy.

First, let's create a FastAPI version of our application:

Now, let's extract the core resume reviewer functionality into a separate module:

Now, let's update the requirements.txt for our FastAPI application:

Now, let's create a Dockerfile to containerize our application:

Let's also create a docker-compose file for easier deployment:

Finally, let's create a README file with instructions on how to use the application:

I've transformed the resume review application into a containerized FastAPI web service. Here's an overview of what I've created:

## Project Structure

```
resume-review-api/
├── app.py                # FastAPI application
├── resume_reviewer.py    # Core resume reviewer functionality
├── requirements.txt      # Python dependencies
├── Dockerfile            # Container definition
├── docker-compose.yml    # Container orchestration
└── README.md             # Documentation
```

## Key Components

1. **FastAPI Application (`app.py`)**
   - Built with FastAPI framework for high-performance APIs
   - Provides two endpoints for analyzing resumes:
     - `/analyze` for JSON input
     - `/analyze_text` for plain text input with delimiter
   - Auto-generates API documentation
   - Returns detailed analysis with recommendations

2. **Resume Reviewer Module (`resume_reviewer.py`)**
   - Contains the core functionality
   - Text preprocessing and skill extraction
   - Similarity calculation using TF-IDF and cosine similarity
   - Score calculation for skills, education, and experience

3. **Docker Integration**
   - **Dockerfile**: Builds a lightweight Python container
   - **docker-compose.yml**: Simplifies deployment
   - Mounts source code as volumes for easier development

## How to Use

1. **Deploy with Docker:**
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

2. **Access API endpoints:**
   - API documentation at `http://localhost:8000/docs`
   - Health check at `http://localhost:8000/`
   - Resume analysis at `http://localhost:8000/analyze` (JSON) or `http://localhost:8000/analyze_text` (plain text)

3. **Example Request (JSON):**
   ```json
   {
     "job_description": "Looking for Python developer with Django experience",
     "resume": "Software engineer with 3 years of Python and Django experience"
   }
   ```

4. **Example Response:**
   ```json
   {
     "overall_match_score": 85.25,
     "similarity_score": 78.5,
     "skill_match": {
       "percentage": 100.0,
       "matching_skills": ["python", "django"],
       "missing_skills": []
     },
     "education_score": 60.0,
     "experience_score": 80.0,
     "recommendations": [
       "Your resume is a strong match for this position!",
       "Make sure your resume is well-formatted and error-free.",
       "Prepare to discuss your experience with the matching skills in interviews."
     ]
   }
   ```

## Benefits of This Approach

1. **Scalable**: FastAPI is highly performant and can handle many concurrent requests
2. **Easy Deployment**: Docker containerization means consistent deployment across environments
3. **User-Friendly API**: Multiple input formats and comprehensive documentation
4. **Extensible**: Easy to add more features or improve the matching algorithm
